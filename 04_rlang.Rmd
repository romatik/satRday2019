# rlang

The rlang package provides tools to work with core language features of R and the tidyverse:

1. The tidy eval framework, which is a well-founded system for non-standard evaluation built on quasiquotation (`!!`) and quoted arguments (`enquo()`).
1. User-friendly error reporting with backtraces and chained errors (`abort()`, `trace_back()`, `with_abort()`).
1. A consistent API for working with base types. Note that overall this is a work in progress that is still in flux.

# Initial commit of rlang/lazyeval

First commit: `2014-08-12 21:15` by Hadley Wickham.

Current iteration of rlang is not the first attempt to introduce quasiquotation.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(lazyeval)
f = function(col1, col2, new_col_name) {
    mutate_call = lazyeval::interp(~ a + b, 
                                   a = as.name(col1), 
                                   b = as.name(col2))
    mtcars %>% mutate_(.dots = setNames(list(mutate_call), 
                                        new_col_name))
}
```

# Why tidyeval

1. Programming over quoting `tidyverse` functions (e.g., `dplyr`, `ggplot2`) <sup>1</sup>.

# 5 big ideas of tidyeval <sup>1</sup>

1. R code is a tree.
1. You can capture the tree by quoting.
1. Unquoting makes it easy to build trees.
1. Quoting + unquoting to write functions.
1. Quosures capture expression and environment.
