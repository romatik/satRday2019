# Plan for today

1. Brief intro to `tidymodels`.
1. Part 1 of the demo: `dials` + `parsnip`.
1. Break.
1. Part 2 of the demo: `recipes`.
1. Extracurricular activities.

# tidymodels

tidymodels is a "meta-package" for modeling and statistical analysis that share the underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures of the tidyverse.

1. `broom` takes the messy output of built-in functions in R, such as lm, nls, or t.test, and turns them into tidy data frames.
1. `infer` is a modern approach to statistical inference.
1. `recipes` is a general data preprocessor with a modern interface. 
1. `rsample` has infrastructure for resampling data so that models can be assessed and empirically validated.
1. `yardstick` contains tools for evaluating models (e.g. accuracy, RMSE, etc.)
1. `tidypredict` translates some model prediction equations to SQL for high-performance computing.
1. `tidyposterior` can be used to compare models using resampling and Bayesian analysis.
1. `tidytext` contains tidy tools for quantitative text analysis, including basic text summarization, sentiment analysis, and text modeling.
1. `dials` contains tools to create and manage values of tuning parameters and is designed to integrate well with the parsnip package.

# Current state

1. Current version - `r packageVersion("tidymodels")`.
1. https://github.com/r-lib/tidymodels
1. Developed by __Max Kuhn__, Hadley Wickham.
1. Very early stage.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tibble::tibble(package = c("broom", "infer", "recipes", "rsample", "yardstick", "tidypredict", "tidyposterior", "tidytext", "parsnip", "dials")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(version = purrr::map_chr(package, ~as.character(packageVersion(.x))))
```

1. [`caret`](https://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html)
1. [`mlr`](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr)
1. [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
1. Apache Spark with, e.g., [`sparklyr`](https://spark.rstudio.com/)
1. [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tutorial.html)
1. [CRAN Machine Learning taskview](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MachineLearning.html)
1. More?

# Extended demo

We will have a (very) condensed walkthrough of 2-day workshop "Applied Machine Learning" by Max Kuhn that he had during `rstudio::conf(2019L)`.

This should give you an idea about what `tidymodels` is planning to be and what is possible already now.

This is **NOT** a Machine Learning tutorial!
