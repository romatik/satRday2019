```

# House rules

1. Questions are always welcome.
1. Will work in small teams (2-3 people).
1. https://rstudio.cloud/project/381312
1. How we'll learn about packages.

# What does "advanced" mean here?

1. You know what `select` does.
1. You are comfortable with R in general.
1. You want to learn a bit more "under the hood".
1. You want to understand why and how packages are changed.
1. You would like to have a better grasp at how different parts of `tidyverse` are connected.

countdown(minutes = 1, seconds = 0, bottom = 0)
```
